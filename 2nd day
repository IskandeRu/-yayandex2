Subqueiries 


???!?!?

      @Cross Join 
      
Number of joins in the first table will multiply by the number of rows in the 2nd table
Select 
name,
surname
From Dnevnik cross join uchebniki

      @Inner Join
      
      /* тут двойной иннер. по двум таблицам
      
SELECT f.*, shippers.CompanyName as ShipperCompanyName 
FROM 
 	(SELECT orders.orderID, orders.CustomerID, 	customers.CompanyName, orders.ShipperID, 	orders.FreightWeight, orders.orderDate
	FROM [orders]
	INNER JOIN customers
	ON orders.CustomerID=customers.CustomerID) as f
INNER JOIN Shippers
ON f.ShipperID = shippers.ShipperID

Outer join - join all the data 

Alias 

to make easy access to the tables 
smth like

...From Orders as o 


      @Union
Select city, prof 
from customers where city = 'Moscow'
union
select city, numbertel
from suppliers where city ='Moscow' 
order by prof

Nice passing of the test 
Okay: mainstones are

don't grab unnessesary data 
be strategic
The more tables - slowly working
